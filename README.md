# esp32_is2_adc_reading

This is a code for ESP32 chip, coded in C for use in Arduino IDE, that demostrates how yo use I2S interface along with ADC.

Code is based on code found here: https://www.instructables.com/The-Best-Way-for-Sampling-Audio-With-ESP32/ which is also based on codes I've seen in other sites.

This code has many many comentaries for learning purpose, based on my own experience, that will focus on several details that can be easily skiped. That was for me, at least. Take a look.
